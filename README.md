# pl

A bash interface for gnuplot.

## Instalation

You can clone the repository with `git clone` or download the [zip file](https://github.com/andreshp/pl/archive/master.zip). Afterwards,
the code needs to be compiled using make, which will ask you to install the dependencies that you don't have installed. At last, if you want to use pl as an usual bash command, you should add the bin directory to the global variable PATH. To accomplish this, add the following line to your .bashrc file:

~~~
PATH=$PATH:<absolute path to /pl/bin/>
~~~
