        pl, a command line interface for gnuplot


pl allows the user to make 2D plots in just a line of code.

SYPNOSIS

pl <some arguments> <files with the data to plot> <other arguments>

DESCRIPTION

pl plots files with at least two columns separated by a delimiter. The first one contains the abscissas of the points to plot. Each of the other columns contains an ordinate for each abscissa, defining a point which is plotted. The points in the same column represent a line and are plotted with the same color.

You can execute `pl -e` to obtain a file example.csv which is easily plotted executing `pl example.csv`.

pl consider as files those words wich contains a dot, such as example.csv. You can pass as many files as you want, obtaining an image with all the associated lines with differents colors. However, if your file does not contain a dot, please, use the argument -f before the file name.

PARAMETERS

-c <color name>
 Plots the image with variations of the color chosen. You can choose among: blue, cyan, green, magenta, red and yellow.

 -c <R,G,B>
 Plots the image with variations of the color chosen. You must provide a tuple R,G,B with the color's RGB representation. Each value is an integer between 0 and 255.

 -d <character>
 The given character is set as the files delimiter. This character is set to ',' by default.

 -e
 Builds an example .csv file and exits afterwards. This file can be used to try pl.

 -f <file name or multiple files names between "">
 The given files are plotted. You can provide files names without -f if they contain a dot.

 -h
 Shows the command help.

 -k
 Keeps the file plot.sh with the instruction to make the plot with gnuplot.

 -l
 The program will take the first entry in each column as the legend.

 -o <file name>
 Sets the name of the plotted image.

 -s <style>
 Sets the style of the plotted lines. You can choose among points, lines and linespoints (chosen by default). Possible uses are:
 -l points, -l lines, -l linespoints or, respectively, -lp, -ll, -llp

-t <title>
Sets the image's title. You can provide a word or a text line between "".

-w <line width>
Sets the line's width to the chosen integer, starting at 0. It is set to 2 by default.

-x <x label>
Sets the image's label for the x axis. You can provide a word or a text line between "".

-y <y label>
Sets the image's label for the y axis. You can provide a word or a text line between "".
